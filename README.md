# Buzzer to hand disinfectant

This project was my final project for the "Sensors and Electronics" class of my Master's Degree in Biomedical Engineering.

## The problem it solves

This projects came to mind to solve an existing problem: the problem of people walking by disinfectants without using it.

## Hardware and functionality
- Arduino Uno
- 2 PIR sensors (infrared sensors)
- 1 module groove speaker
- 1 Breadboard
- Some wires

The prototype has two PIR sensors, one on top of the disinfectant, and another half meter ahead of the first. When the first one detects movement, meaning a person disinfected his hands, when he passes the second PIR sensor, the buzzer doesn't give any output sound. But when the second PIR sensor detects movement, without the first one detected, meaning a person passed by the first sensor without disinfecting his hands, the buzzer emits sound.
